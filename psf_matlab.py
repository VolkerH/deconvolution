%%Example usage:
%%Note that for large z sections, the algorithms speed is dependent on the
%%2D fFTs
%%Without spherical aberration, and normalized to l-infinity:
%%Microscope objective: 63X/1.4, oil immersion
%%CCD camera pixel size: 6.45 microns
%%Fluorophore is GFP and excited in blue
% psf = wfmpsf(488, 520, 1.4, 63, 1.518, 6450, 300, 128, 64, 1.518, 0, 0);
%
%%With spherical aberration:
%%Microscope objective: 63X/1.4, oil immersion
%%CCD camera pixel size: 6.45 microns
%%Specimen immersed has a buffer index of 1.45
%%and imaged at 15 microns in depth
%%Fluorophore is GFP and excited in blue
% psf = wfmpsf(488, 520, 1.2, 40, 1.33, 6450, 300, 256, 128, 1.45, 15000, 0);

%%To plot the PSFs:
% load cmap_fire;
%%Remove the errors due to the Fourier transform
% psf(psf<5.7e-06) = 5.7e-06;
